# Residual effect of a disinfectant on hand bacterial concentrations
## Experimental protocol
An experiment was carried out in a biological research facilitiy whre one hand from 10 people (left or right) was cleaned with a sanitiser. Their other hand was sampled as a control. Over the next 6 hours 5 participants hands' were sampled every hour for microorganisms, after which these 5 left. The other 5 participants (who had not been previously sampled but had been treated) were then sampled from hours 16 to 24 after sanitiser application.

## Results
The following graph shows the concentration of aerobic colony counts on participants' hand over time. The points are coloured by treatment group.
